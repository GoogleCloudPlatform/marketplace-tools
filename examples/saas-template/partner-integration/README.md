# SaaS Test Tool
This page describes how to set up a billing account, project, a service account, and use BigQuery billing export, on Google Cloud to run the SaaS Test Tool using `mpdev`.

## Setup


### Configure your test billing account
To run the SaaS Test Tool, you must create a test billing account. Usage with this billing account is 100% discounted to prevent unexpected charges for testing.


#### Create your billing account
To create a new billing account, follow the instructions at [Create a new Cloud Billing account](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/manage-billing-account#create_a_new_billing_account).


#### Configure a 100% Discount for your billing account
> **ðŸ›ˆ NOTE:** The background process takes 24 hours to complete.


> **ðŸ›ˆ NOTE:** You must use the same project that created the SaaS product youâ€™re testing.


1. Navigate to [Billing](https://console.cloud.google.com/billing) and select the billing account you created previously.
1. In the left navigation panel, click **Account management**.
1. Copy the **Billing account ID**.

## Using `mpdev` to run the SaaS Test Tool


### Before you begin
To use `mpdev` to run the SaaS Test Tool, you must install both `Docker` and `mpdev`.

1. To install Docker for Linux, follow the [Docker installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).
1. To install mpdev, follow the installation instructions for [marketplace-tools](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/marketplace-tools#installation).


### Create your local sandbox
> **ðŸ›ˆ NOTE:** These instructions have only been tested on Linux.


After you install all the required dependencies, you must create a working directory that you use to store service account credentials and configuration files.

```bash
mkdir -p ~/saas-test-tool-sandbox
cd ~/saas-test-tool-sandbox

# Pull a sample SaaS Test Tool configuration and place it in your sandbox directory.
# Include the dot (.) in the end of the command.
mpdev pkg get https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/marketplace-tools.git/examples/saas-template/partner-integration .

cd partner-integration
```


### Download your service account token
The SaaS Test Tool must authenticate with Google Cloud to create/delete orders and query usage data. You can use a JSON Web Token (JWT) to do this.

> **ðŸ›ˆ NOTE:** You must use the same project you created previously.


1. Go to the [Service Accounts](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts) page.
1. Select the service account you created previously.
1. Go to the **KEYS** tab.
1. Select ADD **KEY > Create new key**.
1. Select the **JSON** key type.
1. Click **CREATE**.
1. Save the credential file as `cred.json`.
1. Copy the credential file to the `~/saas-test-tool-sandbox/partner-integration` sandbox directory you created previously.


### Update your SaaS Test Tool configuration file
The configuration file contains the following information:
* The SaaS product that you want to test.
* The plans you want to test orders/upgrades on.
* The 100% discounted test billing account to use.
* A docker run command that runs a driver.
* Expected usage billing after running the driver.


The driver is any Docker image that emulates usage of the SaaS product that youâ€™re testing. That usage is reported to Google Cloud, and the SaaS Test Tool checks to see if the usage is within the expected range.


#### Hereâ€™s an example of a working configuration file:
```yaml
apiVersion: dev.marketplace.cloud.google.com/v1alpha1
kind: SaasListingTemplate
credFilePath: cred.json
integrationTestConfig:
  provider: "providers/e2e-testing"

          tableName: "testing-producer-saas-322600.testing_producer_saas_billing_export.gcp_billing_export_resource_v1_017778_0B6CC1_FB92E9"
        expectation:
          skuId: "0D8F-CA36-DD7A"
          usageExpectation:
            min: 150
            max: 200
            baseUnits: "requests"
          costExpectation:
            min: 800
            max: 1000
            currency: "USD"
```


### Run the SaaS Test Tool test
> **ðŸ›ˆ NOTE:** It takes approximately 8 hours for the billing export to complete, so it takes approximately 8 hours for the SaaS Test Tool to test billing usage.


> **ðŸ›ˆ NOTE:** Logs are written to `output.log` in the same directory as the configuration file

```bash
cd ~/saas-test-tool-sandbox/partner-integration

mpdev test -f config.yaml 2>&1 | tee output.log
```
